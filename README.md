# SuperCook Testing

The aim of this project is to thoroughly test the core functionalities of the Android Super Cook app using Appium, a popular mobile automation testing framework. The testing approach will follow the Page Object Model (POM) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles, utilizing the Python Behave framework. Additionally, the project will leverage Allure reports to generate comprehensive test reports and enhance test result visualization.

## Project Objectives:

- Test Core Functionalities: Conduct systematic testing of the Android Super Cook app to ensure all its core features and functionalities work as expected.
- Automation with Appium: Utilize Appium, an open-source mobile automation framework, to automate the testing process for the Android Super Cook app.
- Page Object Model: Implement the Page Object Model design pattern to enhance test maintenance, readability, and reusability.
- Behavior-Driven Development: Adopt the Behavior-Driven Development approach using the Python Behave framework, enhancing the clarity of test scenarios.
- Allure Reports: Generate comprehensive Allure reports to provide detailed test execution summaries, metrics, and visualizations for better analysis and reporting.
